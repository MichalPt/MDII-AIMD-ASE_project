# Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics
This project is a final exam project for the course "Molecular Dynamics II" held at Charles University in Prague, Czechia, in the winter of 2021.

The task was to implement an ab-initio molecular simulation of a cation water dimer, the so-called Zundel cation, using different levels of ab-initio theory (DFTB3, B3LYP) and different interaction calculators (ORCA, Psi4, CP2K). The ASE Python package for atomistic simulations was used to govern the simulations.
